Extra Credit:

1. Search Feature:
   - I intentionally delete the submit button from the HTML 
     <input type="submit" value="&#x1F50D;" id="search-submit" class="search-submit">
   - Instead, the search feature will update dynamically on "keyup" event

2. Modal toggle:
   - To prevent errors, once the end or beginning of the list is reached, the prev/next button will be hidden

3. Structure, style and CSS:
   - when the card is being hovered, the background color of the card turn lightgreen
